## 🧠 Overview

Designed for cybersecurity pros, developers, hackers, and privacy absolutists who demand **total local control**. This tool fuses modern cryptography (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20) with hardened security principles (Argon2, MFA, secure clipboard, breach detection) into one **bulletproof personal vault**.

No cloud. No sync. No compromise.
